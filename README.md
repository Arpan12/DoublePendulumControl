# Acrobat / Double Pendulum Control
Non Linear Trajectory optimisation using multiple shoot method

Double pendulum have highly non linear dymanics. Thats why making controlling them and making them reach a desired state is an interesting control problem. This code makes a double pendulum stand straight by controlling a torque only at the mid joint using multiple shooting method. The result would look something like this.
